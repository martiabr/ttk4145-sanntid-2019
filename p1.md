# Mutex and Channel basics

### What is an atomic operation?
> Atomic operations are operations that have no observable, intermediate state, and thus does not produce race conditions.
Designing a concurrent program with atomic operations is a fast and simple way of avoiding race conditions. While
only simple operations are atomic, they do not add as much complexity as say a mutex.


### What is a semaphore?
> A semaphore is a variable used to manage shared memory in multithreaded systems, to avoid race conditions.
Semaphores are usually non-negative integer flags, which has to basic operations: increment/signal and decrement/wait. The value
of the semaphore then represents how many resources are available. Binary semaphores are very common, in which case
the resource is either available or it is not.

### What is a mutex?
> Mutex: mutually exclusive flag. If you extend the idea of a binary semaphore with ownership of the resource in question,
we have a mutex. So a mutex allows us to lock a shared resource for one owner at a time, thus dealing with the race condition problem.

### What is the difference between a mutex and a binary semaphore?
> As discussed above, a mutex deals with locking down a resource so only the thread with ownership
can read/write to said resource. A binary semaphore does not have an idea of ownership, and is only a signaling
mechanism for if other threads have to continue to wait for an action to happen or if that action has happened and
the threads need to deal with that action.

### What is a critical section?
> A critical section are the parts of a program which cannot operate correctly if several threads have access to them
simultaneously. The critical section therefore needs to be protected by a mutex lock.

### What is the difference between race conditions and data races?
 > A data race happens when two or more threads try to access the same resource concurrently, and at least one thread writes
 to the resource when no mutex is used on the resource. This will have a negative impact on the correctness of the program.
 A race condition is only a situation in which the outcome depends on ordering in time, which might be the case in a data race.

### List some advantages of using message passing over lock-based synchronization primitives.
> Message passing means we have no shared resources between processes, and we therefore avoid the problems that was discussed above,
like data races. Furthermore message passing systems are very simple to understand and model. In my opinion this makes for
better and more maintainable code, as programmers do not need to deal with protecting resources - modularization!

### List some advantages of using lock-based synchronization primitives over message passing.
> The problem with message passing is that we do not have global consensus, as we have no shared memory. In many cases it
might be difficult to sync the processes such that they all agree, which might lead to unexpected behaviour.
Furthermore, message passing is slower than shared memory. In high performance systems where a lot of data needs to be handled,
message passing might not meet the specs we desire...
