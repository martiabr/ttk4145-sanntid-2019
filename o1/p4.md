We observe different results each time. This is because foo.go introduces a race condition.
The two goroutines are done concurrently by the OS scheduler, and we have no control over when things are done.
That means that thread 1 might read i and calculate the new incremented value for i, and then get paused by the scheduler. 
If thread 2 now decrements i a hundred times and the scheduler passes the ball back to thread 1, the thread will write
the old value to i in memory, and all the work by thread 2 will be disregarded. This is why we get seemingly random results each time. 
We need to use synchronization or messages to handle this (messages in golang).
